\f0\fs24 \cf0 This repository contains the Python and R code used in our thesis.\
\
To run the code, you need both Python and R installed. We recommend using the setup guides provided by tidy-finance.org:\
\
https://www.tidy-finance.org/python/setting-up-your-environment.html\
https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/setting-up-your-environment.html\
\
In general, the code should run on both newer and older versions of these environments. That said, future compatibility issues may arise, as pandas occasionally deprecates functions.\
\
In addition to the programming environments, access to CRSP data is required to run the code as intended. Please also note that some time conventions for stock data may differ between datasets.\
\
Finally, access to an HPC environment is recommended for running the machine learning models. We use uCloud, accessed via KU, with the following specifications:\
\
64 Intel cores\
384 GB RAM}
